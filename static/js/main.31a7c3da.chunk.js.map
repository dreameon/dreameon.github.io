   <p>\n                  I founded my small art business, Oh My Dreameon, in 2018,\n                  where I sold enamel pins and other art that I designed. In the\n                  first 2 years, I was able to reach 1,200 followers on\n                  Instagram and sold $3000 worth of goods. As it was primarily a\n                  side hobby to my studies, there was limited brand planning\n                  conducted; instead, I was focused on simply designing new\n                  artwork to sell.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  In 2023, I completed my studies and had more time to involve\n                  myself in my small business once again. I wanted to branch\n                  into the home decor and fashion industry and hence decided to\n                  rebrand and implement necessary changes to formally make Oh My\n                  Dreameon into a well-maintained small business.\n                </p>\n                <p>The branding revamp would have three parts:</p>\n                <ol>\n                  <li> Developing a new brand name</li>\n                  <li>Designing a logo and other necessary assets</li>\n                  <li>Formulating a palette (colour scheme)</li>\n                </ol>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Mission</h3>\n                <p>\n                  The idea to revamp my business came to me while I was\n                  completing my exchange studies in Japan, where I saw many\n                  products with a “cute” aesthetic that didn’t exist in Canada\n                  yet. I observed many North American tourists as they visited\n                  Japan, and noticed that they gravitated towards this\n                  aesthetic. Their love for these products, coupled with the\n                  rise of Japanese animation (anime) in the West, inspired me to\n                  create a local product where my customers could enjoy this\n                  style without travelling all the way to Japan. As such, I\n                  decided to make the company's mission to deliver a cute,\n                  dreamy, and princess-like lifestyle to North America.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Target Market Analysis</h3>\n                <p>\n                  Based on Etsy consumer data and Instagram insights, Oh My\n                  Dreameon’s market consisted of mainly females in their 20s to\n                  30s, with an interest in anime and Japanese pop culture, who\n                  reside in the United States and Canada. Although the product\n                  selection would be slightly different after the rebranding,\n                  the target market should not change as much. This belief was\n                  supported by competitor analysis of peers - other small\n                  business - who also successfully transitioned from enamel pins\n                  to fashion, plushies, and home decor, while still retaining\n                  their key target market.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Conceptualization</h2>\n                <h3>Brand Name</h3>\n                <p>\n                  One of the flaws of Oh My Dreameon’s branding was that the\n                  name was too long for people to remember. As the business’\n                  main presence is on Instagram, the handle, which did not allow\n                  for spaces or special characters, needed to be relatively\n                  simple for prospective and current customers to remember and\n                  to type. From competitor analysis, it appeared that most\n                  successful small business art accounts had a handle that was\n                  four syllables or fewer for memorability as well as\n                  simplicity.\n                </p>\n                <div\n                  className=\"center-flex\"\n                  style={{ padding: \"32px 0 32px 0\" }}\n                >\n                  <img\n                    src={brandName}\n                    alt=\"Name brainstorming\"\n                    style={{ width: \"80%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                  After considering the practical requirements, I listed\n                  potential candidates for the name that aligned with the\n                  desired branding. I wanted the new name to embody our new\n                  mission.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  With Purinpalette being the most memorable, I settled on that\n                  name. However, realizing that this word was difficult to\n                  pronounce with an American accent, I altered the name to\n                  Puripalette instead.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Logo and Assets</h3>\n                <p>\n                  To go along with a memorable name, I needed a fitting logo. I\n                  first tried using the name as the logo, but it looked too\n                  plain and unmemorable.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={logoDraft1}\n                  alt=\"The first draft of the logo, created before the name change into Puripalette\"\n                  width=\"30%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  I then considered a play on words with the Japanese Kanji\n                  character for princess and combining it with other shapes for\n                  the logo, but found several issues with the logo. Firstly, it\n                  lacked memorability; as not many people from my target market\n                  are Japanese, they may not understand nor remember it.\n                  Secondly, the character is difficult to read as a logo.\n                  Although cute, once the heart and moon were included, it\n                  didn’t look like the original character anymore and as such\n                  was indecipherable. Moreover, the thin lettering would be\n                  difficult to see from afar, when tabling at conventions and\n                  other markets.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={logoDraft2}\n                  alt=\"The second draft of the logo, using the Japanese kanji character for princess, 姫\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  As such, I decided to create a mascot, which I would use as my\n                  logo. After drawing a few different animals, I chose a ragdoll\n                  as my mascot, as this particular cat breed gives a regal air\n                  while remaining cute with its thick and fluffy coat. To\n                  perfectly align with the princess theme, I added a tiara to\n                  the ragdoll.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={mascotDraft}\n                  alt=\"Different potential mascots for Puripalette (from left-right, top-down order) cats, otters, the long-tailed tit, and a pudding bear\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                {/* <div style={{display:'flex', alignItems:'baseline', width:'100%', alignItems:'baseline', justifyContent:'center'}}> */}\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={mascotCat}\n                  alt=\"Drafts of the princess ragdoll\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={mascotFinal}\n                  alt=\"Final princess ragdoll logo\"\n                  width=\"30%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  For the typography of the logo, I wanted a font that gave off\n                  a sweet ambience, looked elegant, but also retained a bit of\n                  youth and cuteness. I also considered letter case and\n                  stylization, which would alter how the brand is perceived\n                  (e.g., if the name is all lowercase, it appears more casual\n                  and less intimidating, but less proper, and if it were\n                  capitalized then it’d seem more proper, but less\n                  approachable). Ultimately, after trying out different styles,\n                  I decided to use Parisienne as the logo font. For the Japanese\n                  version, I also looked at different fonts and ultimately chose\n                  yosugara due to its authenticity and simplicity.\n                </p>\n                <div>\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={fonts}\n                    alt=\"Variations of the name with different fonts and stylizations\"\n                    width=\"50%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={logoFont}\n                    alt=\"Testing Puripalette mascot with different fonts\"\n                    width=\"50%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={logoFinal}\n                    alt=\"Final logo, with font\"\n                    width=\"30%\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>\n                <p>\n                  For the colour scheme, I went with pink and white to match the\n                  princess aesthetic. However, as there are many different\n                  shades of pink, there were quite a few different options to\n                  choose from. I proceeded to draft different business cards in\n                  different colours and styles, eliminating those that align\n                  less with the initial desired aesthetic. As of writing, I am\n                  still in the middle of deciding between the different colour\n                  schemes.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={businessCards}\n                  alt=\"Business cards, in different colour schemes and styles\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  I am aware that the current colour scheme is a bit difficult\n                  to read so I will continue to think of improvements to balance\n                  aesthetic with legibility and accessibility.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Puripalette;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../css/index.css\";\nimport ImageCard from \"../ImageCard\";\nimport drafts from \"./drafts.png\";\nimport utensilDraft from \"./utensil draft.png\";\nimport utensilDraft2 from \"./utensil draft 2.png\";\nimport cup from \"./cup.png\";\nimport plate from \"./plate.png\";\nimport teapot from \"./teapot.png\";\nimport diffuser from \"./diffuser.gif\";\nimport teacupSM from \"./teacup sm.png\";\nimport teapotSM from \"./teapot sm.png\";\nimport plateSM from \"./plate sm.png\";\nimport teacupRef from \"./teacup ref.png\";\nimport teapotRef from \"./teapot ref.png\";\nimport utensilsRef from \"./utensils ref.png\";\nimport teacupDraft1 from \"./teacup draft 1.png\";\nimport teacupDraft2 from \"./teacup draft 2.png\";\nimport teasetModel1 from \"./teaset model1.png\";\nimport teasetModel2 from \"./teaset model2.png\";\nimport teasetModelFinal from \"./teaset model final.png\";\nimport staffWing from \"./staff wing.svg\";\nimport smallWings from \"./small wings.svg\";\nimport flightBow from \"./flight bow.svg\";\nimport decals from \"./decals.png\";\nimport decal2 from \"./decal 2.png\";\nimport newGoldColour from \"./new gold colour.png\";\nimport newDecals from \"./newDecals.png\";\nimport newDecals2 from \"./new decals 2.png\";\nimport completedSet from \"./completed set.png\";\nimport utensilExplanation from \"./utensilExplanation.jpg\";\nimport utensilDrawing from \"./utensil drawing.jpg\";\nimport cutleryRef2 from \"./cutlery reference 2.png\";\nimport crown from \"./crown.png\";\nimport goldColour from \"./gold colour.jpg\";\nimport champagneColour from \"./champagne colour.jpg\";\nimport utensilJewels from \"./utensil jewels.png\";\nimport cutleryMold from \"./cutlery mold.jpg\";\nimport cutlerySample from \"./cutlery sample.jpg\";\nimport pinkBG from \"./pink bg.png\";\nimport blueBG from \"./blue bg.png\";\nimport assets from \"./assets.png\";\nimport teasetBlurb from \"./teaset blurb.png\";\nimport teapotBlurb from \"./teapot blurb.png\";\nimport teacupBlurb from \"./teacup blurb.png\";\nimport cutleryBlurb from \"./cutlery blurb.png\";\nimport ksVideo from \"./ks video.gif\";\nimport washiTape from \"./ccs post 2.png\";\nimport enamelPin from \"./ccs post 3.png\";\nimport ccsBrainstorm from \"./ccs brainstorm.png\";\nimport smBrainstorm from \"./sailor moon brainstorm.png\";\n\nfunction ClearCardTeaSet() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"project\">\n      <div className=\"project-overview\">\n        <div className=\"title\"> clear card tea set </div>\n        <div className=\"project-synopsis\">\n          A Cardcaptor Sakura (Clamp, 2016) inspired design\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"project-container\">\n        <div className=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-header\">\n            <h1>Design</h1>\n            <hr />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-section-text\">\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Idea Generation, Motivation, and Research</h2>\n                <p>\n                  The Clear Card tea set was my first project upon returning to\n                  the art circle, after 2 years of social media hiatus. As the\n                  break had significantly lowered my online engagement, I needed\n                  a project that would help rebuild my clientele once again. I\n                  started brainstorming ideas and decided to leverage the\n                  recognition of another franchise through a fan-art project to\n                  make my business more well-known. As I had previously had\n                  success with my Magical Girl Enamel Pin Kickstarter, which\n                  featured Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura inspired desserts\n                  and raised $2,400, I knew that magical girl anime had a\n                  market, that I possessed the passion for and abundant\n                  knowledge about the topic, and that it was niche enough that\n                  people would be interested in sharing the project to others.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Immediately, a high tea set came to mind, as both magical\n                  girls and tea parties share a similar princess-like aesthetic.\n                  Since the largest two magical girl anime franchises in North\n                  America are Cardcaptor Sakura and Sailor Moon, I decided to\n                  start with these two franchises. I then spent the next few\n                  days brainstorming on a vision for each set.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Conceptualization</h2>\n                <p>\n                  To ensure that the tea set embodies the series well, I used a\n                  word-association approach to brainstorm. I first listed motifs\n                  and keywords that relate to the series. From there, I started\n                  expanding onto some adjectives and emotion-driven words that\n                  relate to the motifs, replicating the overall atmosphere of\n                  the series with the tea set. Lastly, I came up with tangible\n                  aspects of the tea set, including shape, material, and\n                  colours.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  With the last iteration of the brainstorming, I proceeded to\n                  look for inspiration from both official merchandise and other\n                  tea sets to have a better idea of what is feasible and what is\n                  common or desired among tea sets. I created an inspiration\n                  board and jotted down ideas whenever they came to mind.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={ccsBrainstorm}\n                  alt=\"Brainstorm for the Cardcaptor Sakura tea set\"\n                  width=\"80%\"\n                />\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={smBrainstorm}\n                  alt=\"Brainstorm for the Sailor Moon tea set\"\n                  width=\"60%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  As I had a clearer vision for the Cardcaptor set and the\n                  design I had in mind was simpler to implement, I chose that\n                  one to pursue.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Design development</h2>\n                <p>\n                  By this point of the process, I already had a good idea of the\n                  overall style of the tea set. To depict the youthfulness,\n                  innocence, and bubbly personality of the main character Sakura\n                  Kinomoto, the main body of the teapot and teacup would be\n                  round and made of glass, featuring her main colour, sakura\n                  pink, through a gradient that fades bottom-up. The teacup\n                  would be accompanied with a glass sakura-shaped saucer also\n                  featuring the same gradient. To further the representation of\n                  Sakura’s character in the tea set, the teapot’s lid would be\n                  flat and shaped similar to her beret in one of her battle\n                  outfits. On the other hand, the cutlery would feature Sakura’s\n                  magical star wands and coloured rose-gold to add a touch of\n                  magic and elegance.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  To emphasize that the glassware and the cutlery are part of\n                  the same set, I decided to add rose-gold accents to the rims\n                  of the teapot, teacup, and saucer and also to add a small\n                  emblem on the back of the glassware and on the tips of the\n                  cutlery.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Using Procreate, I started drafting some potential designs for\n                  the tea set.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={drafts}\n                  alt=\"The choice for the backs was between a small iconic pair of wings that has been a recurring symbol of the series (top row left), or the Dream Key (top row right); and for the front of the teacup, the decision was between the Dream Staff (middle row right) and a simple cherry blossom with wings (middle row centre)\"\n                  width=\"60%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  Since the simple wings would be more feasible to engrave on\n                  the cutlery than the more detailed Dream Key, I decided to use\n                  the wings as the emblem. After considering the balance of the\n                  front designs, I decided to use the Dream Staff as the cherry\n                  blossoms were too intricate and small compared to the large\n                  bow on the teapot.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={cup}\n                    alt=\"Front (left) and back (right) designs of the teacup\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={plate}\n                    alt=\"Drafted design for the saucer\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={teapot}\n                    alt=\"Front (top) and back (bottom) designs of the teapot and teacup\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                  As the tea set was meant for practical purposes, I also\n                  considered potential features I should include to improve its\n                  function. Mainly, I wanted the teapot to have removable glass\n                  tea infuser so that the user doesn’t have to worry about\n                  gathering any other accessories for tea brewing. I also wanted\n                  the pot spout to be designed in a way that doesn’t drip when\n                  tea is poured out, with its opening sideways facing to improve\n                  ergonomics, as the user wouldn’t have to lift the teapot as\n                  high to pour the tea out.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={diffuser}\n                  alt=\"Removable diffuser design\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  I also created a preliminary version of the cutlery set, with\n                  Sakura’s different sealing wands throughout the different\n                  series etched on the ends of the handles. However, later on in\n                  the design process, I thought it would be more cohesive to\n                  simply have the tea set Clear Card themed. After confirming\n                  that my followers also preferred the change, I designed a new\n                  set of utensils to feature the three Guardians that appear in\n                  the series. This time, I proceeded with a sleeker and more\n                  refined design to make the utensils more dainty and\n                  luxury-like, such as using slender necks for the handles and\n                  changing the shape of the butter knife blade.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={utensilDraft}\n                    alt=\"First draft of the cutlery set\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={utensilDraft2}\n                    alt=\"Second draft of the cutlery set\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Initial market testing</h2>\n                <p>\n                  To gauge whether there is an interest to the designs, I shared\n                  the drawings on my social media accounts. Although my reach\n                  and engagement was low from the hiatus, there was a still a\n                  12% interaction rate from Instagram as well as various\n                  positive comments, signifying that people were receptive to\n                  the designs.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard src={teacupSM} alt=\"Teacup design\" width=\"100%\" />\n                  <ImageCard src={teapotSM} alt=\"Teapot design\" width=\"100%\" />\n                  <ImageCard src={plateSM} alt=\"Saucer design\" width=\"100%\" />\n                </div>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-header\">\n            <h1>Prototyping</h1>\n            <hr />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-section-text\">\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <p>\n                  Due to the differences in manufacturing needs (e.g., materials\n                  used, craftsmanship, and other field-dependent expertise), it\n                  made sense to split the prototyping into two separate,\n                  parallel procedures; one for the glassware (i.e., the teapot,\n                  teacup, and saucer), and the other for the cutlery set.\n                  However, since the overall process is similar for the two, I\n                  have summarized each into four main steps: 1) selection of\n                  materials, 2) search for a manufacturer, 3) modelling for the\n                  purpose of mold-creation, and 4) post-processing of the\n                  prototypes.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Glassware Prototyping</h2>\n                <h3>Material Selection</h3>\n                <p>\n                  The main consideration when deciding which glass to use was\n                  its thermal shock resistance. As the glassware would be used\n                  for hot tea, it must withstand sudden changes to temperatures\n                  without cracking or breaking. Hence, I went with high\n                  borosilicate glass, a glass that is widely used in glass\n                  teapots and teacups due to its durability. On the other hand,\n                  there was less of a need to use high-borosilicate glass for\n                  the saucer for several reasons. Firstly, while the saucer also\n                  has contact with heat, it is to a much lesser degree as it’s\n                  separated by the teacup walls. Moreover, some people may\n                  choose to use the saucer as a plate for snacks and desserts\n                  instead and not require thermal shock resistance at all. It\n                  was hence decided that the saucer will be made of soda-lime\n                  glass instead, which is cheaper.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Manufacturer Search</h3>\n                <p>\n                  Several factors were considered when finding a manufacturer.\n                  First and foremost, as a small business with low volumes of\n                  orders, commitment to large volume production is risky, hence\n                  it was important to find a factory with a low minimum order\n                  quantity (MOQ). However, any product that requires molding\n                  usually has an inevitably high MOQ due to the resources spent\n                  on designing the mold, so in this case, the requirement for\n                  “low MOQ” was relative rather than absolute.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Secondly, the unit cost was considered. While a lower MOQ can\n                  cut costs, it may be negated with a significantly higher unit\n                  price. Hence, ensuring that the unit cost offered by the\n                  manufacturer is competitive is crucial.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Thirdly, the manufacturer’s expertise was also considered. As\n                  the tea set is delicate and decorative, it would be ideal to\n                  find a manufacturer that had experience with detailed\n                  post-processing (i.e., gradient colouring for the glass, gold\n                  plating for the rims, and decals for the designs).\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Lastly, we favoured large manufacturers that a proven history\n                  with trusted clients. Although not necessary, if the\n                  manufacturer boasted its collaboration history with brands\n                  like Disney, Sanrio, or other entertainment companies, they\n                  likely had experience with special customizations such as\n                  printing designs of the characters on the glassware.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Prototype Modelling</h3>\n                <p>\n                  I supplied reference files in addition to the labelled designs\n                  for the manufacturer to get a better sense of the aesthetic\n                  details.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={teacupRef}\n                    alt=\"Reference files for the glassware\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={teapotRef}\n                    alt=\"Reference files for the glassware\"\n                    width=\"100%\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                  Upon starting the modelling process, I was immediately met\n                  with a complication that forced me to revisit my initial\n                  design. After I had a manufacturer representative examined my\n                  design files, I was told that the unusual lid knob shape that\n                  I designed would be difficult to make. The options I had were\n                  limited if I wanted to carry on with it, and I would have to\n                  change to a different supplier in all cases. These options\n                  included using a handmade craft, which would make the\n                  unit-price more expensive and may have more imperfections than\n                  machine-made, or using an acrylic substitute while keeping the\n                  rest of the lid glass. However, only in the first case can the\n                  rim of the knob be painted gold - the latter would have a\n                  plastic-looking, transparent knob.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I was willing to alter my design if it was not feasible, but\n                  wanted the solution that had the best interests of my\n                  customers. I concluded that it was for the better, as I\n                  realized that the current knob may not be user-friendly.\n                  Firstly, its slimness will make it difficult to pick up when\n                  lifting the pot lid. Secondly, the base of the circle is only\n                  secured to the lid with very little surface area. Although\n                  this can be welded using handmade techniques, I was concerned\n                  about it breaking easily through actual usage. Thirdly, the\n                  spikes of the staff may be uncomfortable or even dangerous.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  For all the reasons above, I decided to change the design to\n                  something simpler, thereby allowing me to stick with the\n                  current manufacturer. I decided to make the knob a simple,\n                  gold, traditional, round knob.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Once the design looked good, we moved onto modelling. As the\n                  mold cannot be changed once it is made (unless a new one is\n                  remade for $500USD), the sizing and shape of the model must be\n                  perfect. Using the reference file I supplied, my manufacturer\n                  created some drafts for the shapes of the glassware. It was\n                  difficult translating the design’s round shapes to actual 3D\n                  models, especially since I did not possess a background in 3D\n                  modelling.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={teacupDraft1}\n                    alt=\"First manufacturer drawing of teacup.

The only caveat is that the saucer is textured while the\n                  rest of the glassware is not, so I conducted a poll with my\n                  follower base to ensure they were okay with this change before\n                  accepting this change.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Post-processing</h3>\n                <p>\n                  While the molds were finishing up and the base prototypes were\n                  being made, discussions regarding the decals, glass colouring,\n                  and gold plating to be used on the glassware took place. From\n                  my experience in making enamel pins, I knew that vector files\n                  are needed to preserve quality upon resizing, hence, expecting\n                  that a similar requirement exists for printing decals, I\n                  created the vector files using Affinity Designer for the\n                  designs. The first round of decals had many issues that\n                  required addressing.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={staffWing}\n                    alt=\"Vector file for the staff\"\n                    width=\"80%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={smallWings}\n                    alt=\"Vector file for the wings\"\n                    width=\"50%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={flightBow}\n                    alt=\"Vector file for the bow\"\n                    width=\"50%\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={decals}\n                  alt=\"First round of decals for the bow.

Out of the choices we were able to find, we\n                  prioritized those that appeared to be more detail-oriented and\n                  have experience with intricate designs and offered more than\n                  simple and generic flat tableware on their store pages.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Prototype Modelling</h3>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={utensilsRef}\n                  alt=\"Cutlery reference\"\n                  width=\"60%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  Based on my drawings, the manufacturer started to finalize the\n                  details in order to create some rough drafts of the models.

First, we chose the colour of the gold\n                  polish. As the new cutlery designs have jewel embellishments\n                  that correspond to the original colours of the Guardians, I\n                  decided that gold or champagne instead of rose gold will be\n                  more fitting and complement the colours more. After discussing\n                  possible shades of the gold, we decided on two candidates.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={goldColour}\n                    alt=\"Choices for the cutlery colour (gold)\"\n                    width=\"80%\"\n                  />\n                  <ImageCard\n                    src={champagneColour}\n                    alt=\"Choices for the cutlery colour (champagne)\"\n                    width=\"80%\"\n                  />\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                  Regarding the jewel embellishments, I inquired about their\n                  catalogue and was provided with a few colours to choose from.\n                  Gathering the opinions of my followers on Instagram, I\n                  narrowed it down to a few options. As I was able to make a few\n                  samples to have shipped to me at the same price, I decided to\n                  make four sets of cutlery with different combinations of the\n                  jewels and gold colours.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={utensilJewels}\n                  alt=\"Jewel embellishment combinations\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  After the samples were finished, I noted that the fork prongs\n                  seemed too thick, given the design I provided. However, the\n                  factory insisted that they made them according to the\n                  drawings, and as such, the most they could do is give me a\n                  discount if I wanted to remake the mold. As my followers\n                  thought they looked fine, I found no need to unnecessarily\n                  increase costs and signed them off to be shipped to me.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={cutlerySample}\n                  alt=\"Finished cutlery samples\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n              </section>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-header\">\n            <h1>Funding</h1>\n            <hr />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-section-text\">\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <p>\n                  As I worked with my manufacturers for prototyping, I was\n                  simultaneously preparing to launch a crowdfunding initiative\n                  for the tea set. As I knew many artists that had success on\n                  Kickstarter, and having personal experience with it myself\n                  with my enamel pin ventures, I decided to use Kickstarter once\n                  again. From this point onwards, potential customers will be\n                  referred to as backers.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Kickstarter Planning</h2>\n                <h3>Asset Creation</h3>\n                <p>\n                  Using Figma, I designed various assets that would be used on\n                  the Kickstarter page.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  As the typography affects the portrayal of the project, I\n                  considered different fonts to best evoke a magical ambience. I\n                  decided on Dream Avenue for the banners as it was unique and\n                  high energy, while I used Cormorant Unicase for other\n                  subheadings that required a bit more reading due to its\n                  legibility. For blocks of text, I chose a sans serif font to\n                  display the information in a clear manner, with Poppins as the\n                  final choice due to its round casing matching with the overall\n                  bubbly aesthetic of the set.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Once I decided on fonts, I made many variations of different\n                  components that I would use for the campaign, with an intent\n                  to make them true to the original media.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  For backgrounds, I decided to use a checkered diamond pattern\n                  that is often present in official merchandise promotional art.\n                  I drafted two variations, one with light blue to depict the\n                  “Clear Card” theme, and the other being pink to match the\n                  colours of the tea set. Not wanting to overwhelm the user with\n                  too much pink at once, I decided to alternate between the two\n                  backgrounds, with the headers using the blue to relieve the\n                  eyes as well as distinguish the section titles from the rest\n                  of the content, and for any other background for infographics\n                  and such, I used the pink background.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <div style={{ display: \"flex\", gap: \"20px\", width: \"50%\" }}>\n                    <ImageCard\n                      src={pinkBG}\n                      alt=\"Pink background\"\n                      width=\"100%\"\n                    />\n                    <ImageCard\n                      src={blueBG}\n                      alt=\"Blue background\"\n                      width=\"100%\"\n                    />\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                  As tribute to the official manga logo, I occasionally used\n                  lime green diamond accents but also experimented with blue,\n                  pink, and gold. To embellish the campaign page and to make it\n                  more magical, I added star-shaped and sakura-shaped ornaments\n                  as well as border frames, similar to that which appears on the\n                  original manga cover artwork.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  After playing around with different colour combinations, I\n                  decided on a colour scheme.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard src={assets} alt=\"Kickstarter assets\" width=\"50%\" />\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h3>Layout</h3>\n                <p>\n                  I analyzed other successful art projects on Kickstarter to see\n                  what they share in common and noticed many had formatted their\n                  Kickstarters in similar ways, so I decided to use similar\n                  sections for my own page. With a focus on making the\n                  information easily digestible, I made use of Kickstarter’s\n                  table of contents function to allow backers to easily navigate\n                  between sections, and incorporated information in tables,\n                  graphs, lists, and other visual graphics wherever possible.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard src={ksVideo} alt=\"Kickstarter layout\" width=\"60%\" />\n                <p>\n                  After the skeleton of the Kickstarter page was ready and the\n                  samples arrived to me, I proceeded to take product pictures.\n                  Due to the tight budget that didn’t allow for booking a proper\n                  photoshoot location with good lighting and background, I\n                  considered alternatives that would allow me to easily take\n                  pictures while still allowing them to look professional.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I decided to use white satin as the background to provide a\n                  luxury feel while not taking the main focus away from the tea\n                  set. I then edited the pictures to allow them look more\n                  intricate and mesmerizing.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  While I originally had a page of text describing the tea set\n                  in detail in the product section, I noticed that the length of\n                  the block of text may be intimidating, so I decided to space\n                  it out in between product pictures.\n                </p>\n\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={teasetBlurb}\n                  alt=\"Original teaset description\"\n                  width=\"40%\"\n                />\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={teapotBlurb}\n                  alt=\"New teapot description\"\n                  width=\"40%\"\n                />\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={teacupBlurb}\n                  alt=\"New teacup description\"\n                  width=\"40%\"\n                />\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={cutleryBlurb}\n                  alt=\"New cutlery description\"\n                  width=\"40%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  After adding the pictures to the Kickstarter page, I started\n                  promoting the preview page on Facebook, Instagram, and other\n                  social media. I focused on my own existing pages to target\n                  those that are already supporting me, and furthered it to\n                  groups dedicated to Cardcaptor Sakura to increase my reach,\n                  reaching more than 900 total likes.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The full link of the Kickstarter can be found{\" \"}\n                  <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1227564628/clear-card-tea-set\">\n                    here\n                  </a>\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Financing</h2>\n                <p>\n                  Although I received the price quotation from my manufacturers,\n                  that was merely a portion of the production cost, one of the\n                  many other costs that need to be considered when figuring out\n                  pricing and the Kickstarter goals. I calculated the sum of the\n                  initial prototyping fees, estimated Kickstarter fees, shipping\n                  costs, packaging costs, and other relevant costs, as well as\n                  the desired margin in a spreadsheet, and used that to\n                  determine the Kickstarter goal and tea set price.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  In order to accommodate a variety of budgets, I decided to\n                  include low-cost, high-margin rewards such as enamel pins and\n                  washi tapes to encourage more backers to pledge.\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"section-gallery\">\n                  <ImageCard src={washiTape} alt=\"Washi tapes\" width=\"80%\" />\n                  <ImageCard src={enamelPin} alt=\"Enamel Pins\" width=\"80%\" />\n                </div>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Fulfillment</h2>\n                <p>\n                  I created a plan for fulfillment to ensure that the logistics\n                  were well set up to avoid complications during the launch. As\n                  there were many different tiers with differing package weights\n                  and measurements, I decided to look into pledge managing\n                  services that could help me send out surveys and additional\n                  invoices after the campaign to allow me to stall for shipping\n                  calculation until it was time to fulfill the orders.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I also researched optimal ways of packing glassware to ensure\n                  the glassware would not shatter during transit.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I limited the Kickstarter shipping destinations to the United\n                  States and Canada, as glassware, which is fragile and requires\n                  protective packaging to prevent it from shattering upon\n                  delivery, is relatively complicated to ship, and I have the\n                  most experience shipping to these countries. Unexpectedly,\n                  upon sharing my preview Kickstarter page to groups for\n                  promotion, there was an overwhelming number of requests to\n                  allow international Kickstarter backers. To ensure the\n                  greatest possibility of the Kickstarter’s success, I decided\n                  to open international shipping.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Fulfilling international shipping also meant that other\n                  factors had to be considered, such as VAT and other\n                  duty/import fees, as well as taxes; however, due to the small\n                  scale of the project, sales tax was not a large concern as it\n                  was unlikely to hit the minimum revenue required for sales\n                  tax. As for import fees, it was simpler to have backers pay\n                  for them upon delivery. Although this was not ideal in terms\n                  of customer experience, it was the most feasible method for a\n                  small business owner such as myself. The Kickstarter page was\n                  thus updated to communicate the probability of being charged\n                  duties and other import fees.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-header\">\n            <h1>Lessons</h1>\n            <hr />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-section-text\">\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <p>\n                  There were many learning experiences throughout the project.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Firstly, due to the lack of a 3D model, there were many\n                  miscommunications with the manufacturer, leading to sizing\n                  errors for the teacup and the fork tip. For future projects,\n                  if I were to ever design another 3D product, I should learn to\n                  3D render a model.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Secondly, once I received the samples, I immediately noticed\n                  that I made the mistake in not ensuring that the golds used on\n                  the glassware rims and the cutlery were the same shade,\n                  resulting in a lack of unity I wanted initially. Although I\n                  was able to correct the gold colour afterwards, the extra work\n                  could have been avoided by involving both manufacturers at the\n                  start of colour coordination to ensure coherence among the\n                  different pieces.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Lastly, to make sure that my backers had enough time to save\n                  up money from holiday shopping, I decided to launch the\n                  Kickstarter at the end of February, for 29 days until the end\n                  of March. However, I didn’t take into consideration that my\n                  manufacturers, who were based in China, would be having their\n                  Spring Festival celebrations in February, meaning they would\n                  not be able to be contacted during their 2 week long vacation.\n                  This ended up being yet another consideration for future\n                  endeavours.\n                </p>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ClearCardTeaSet;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"../css/index.css\";\nimport ImageCard from \"../ImageCard\";\nimport shaker from \"./shaker.png\";\nimport colourPalette from \"./colour palette.png\";\nimport characters from \"./characters.png\";\nimport characterSets from \"./character sets.png\";\nimport characterHeadbands from \"./character headbands.png\";\nimport toteBags from \"./tote bags.png\";\nimport jewelry from \"./jewelry.png\";\nimport loungewear from \"./loungewear.png\";\nimport gelatoPique from \"./gelato pique.jpeg\";\nimport newTotes from \"./new totes.gif\";\nimport fabric from \"./fabric.png\";\nimport headbands from \"./headband.png\";\n\nfunction GenshinLoungewear() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"project\">\n      <div className=\"project-overview\">\n        <div className=\"title\"> genshin loungewear </div>\n        <div className=\"project-synopsis\">\n          creating comfy, Genshin Impact (Mihoyo, 2020) inspired home fashion\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"project-container\">\n        <div className=\"project-section\">\n          <div className=\"project-section-header\">\n            <h1>Design</h1>\n            <hr />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-section-text\">\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Idea Generation, Motivation, and Research</h2>\n                <p>\n                  Genshin Impact is a role-playing game I started playing in\n                  2020, when it was first released.

Inspired by my peers, I wanted to\n                  leverage Genshin’s unique and intricate character designs into\n                  making something that could be used on a day-to-day basis.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I started sketching many different potential items, including\n                  tableware, jewelry, and a cocktail set to brainstorm some\n                  ideas, but many had limitations that I wanted to avoid, such\n                  as ease of production. In particular, I learnt from the\n                  Cardcaptor Sakura tea set that production for 3D mold-required\n                  items is a lot more complicated than what I was initially\n                  expected, as it was difficult to communicate specifications\n                  without a 3D model and required a large MOQ due to the mold.\n                  While the cocktail set would likely just be minor alterations\n                  to existing cocktail shakers and stirrers, jewelry would\n                  definitely require an intricate 3D model to effectively\n                  communicate details.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={shaker}\n                  alt=\"Genshin cocktail set idea\"\n                  width=\"90%\"\n                />\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={jewelry}\n                  alt=\"Preliminary jewelry design\"\n                  width=\"60%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  Other issues considered were more general, such as high\n                  shipping costs and lack of demand. Reflecting on the past\n                  Cardcaptor Sakura project once again, shipping costs could\n                  make up for a large portion of the final cost and depend on\n                  the weight as well as volume of the item. For those reasons,\n                  tableware, which may not require a 3D mold but is heavy and\n                  may incur high shipping costs, and the cocktail set, which\n                  seemed to be too niche given my lack of presence in this new\n                  market, seemed to not be ideal.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I proceeded to consider character-inspired headbands, as they\n                  are easy to ship, do not require modelling, and have a proven\n                  market, based on market research. I also considered expanding\n                  the idea to not only headbands, but loungewear sets, inspired\n                  by a popular Japanese company called Gelato Pique, which\n                  creates luxury loungewear using high-quality, lightweight, yet\n                  warm fabrics. This seemed to be perfect as many Genshin Impact\n                  players seemed to enjoy their time at home and hence would\n                  likely have more of a use for a comfortable loungewear set\n                  that they can wear while playing the game.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={gelatoPique}\n                  alt=\"Example of the Gelato Pique loungewear sets\"\n                  width=\"60%\"\n                />\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Conceptualization</h2>\n                <p>\n                  Since my target market was mainly female Genshin Impact\n                  players, who are known to support very specific characters\n                  from the game and have favourites that they will support, I\n                  decided that the characters I feature would greatly determine\n                  the people who buy the sets. As such, I spent most of the\n                  first few days brainstorming which subset of characters I\n                  would base the loungewear set on.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I attempted to base my selection on a theme, such as based on\n                  the location they are canonically from, their age and gender,\n                  or other categories. However, I felt like the lack of\n                  variation would translate into higher risk for the success of\n                  the set. Hence, I chose characters who own familiars, since\n                  the animals match the comfortable theme of the loungewear. Out\n                  of the various characters that fulfill this criteria, I\n                  decided to pick a good selection of popular and more niche\n                  characters to test the market. Once I had a list of potential\n                  characters to include, I moved onto the actual design of the\n                  loungewear set.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={characters}\n                  alt=\"Character choices, with the mascots in the corner if not already displayed in the character portrait\"\n                  width=\"40%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  I started with some sketches of the headbands; however, the\n                  drafts didn’t appeal to me as much as I thought they would, as\n                  it was difficult to visualize how to embody a character\n                  through a simple headband. I hence decided to have the actual\n                  clothes be the focus of the character, while having the\n                  headbands be more of an accessory, so I shifted focus on the\n                  garments.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard src={headbands} alt=\"Headband drafts\" width=\"60%\" />\n                <p>\n                  Although the loungewear sets were mainly meant to be worn\n                  indoors, I wanted users to have the option of wearing the set\n                  outside of their homes, so I still wanted to make them\n                  fashionable. I decided to make the top piece a cardigan, which\n                  had more versatility than a normal loungewear top and allowed\n                  for layering. For the bottoms, I envisioned shorts, allowing\n                  the entire set to be worn year-long even in the warmer seasons\n                  and avoiding the feeling of being confined that normal long\n                  pants may give. It also lessened the problem of sizing, since\n                  pant sizing for long pants is fussier due to the varying\n                  lengths and waist sizes.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  To really make the set as comfortable as possible, I focused\n                  on ensuring that the fit of the loungewear sets would empower\n                  the person wearing it and make them feel good. As such, I went\n                  with a cute oversized fit for the cardigan, which is more\n                  forgiving for different sizes and body shapes. I also noted to\n                  make the shorts high waisted, as I know it’s common among\n                  women to not want to feel exposed around the tummy area, and\n                  made sure that pockets, which are lacking in many women’s\n                  clothing but highly coveted and useful, were present in both\n                  the cardigan and the shorts.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={loungewear}\n                  alt=\"Example of the Gelato Pique loungewear sets\"\n                  width=\"60%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  As an owner of one of Gelato Pique’s products myself, I\n                  envisioned the loungewear set to have the same feel and touch.\n                  Their iconic fabric is soft and fluffy, but breathable. As\n                  someone who suffers from sensory overload, I greatly\n                  appreciate the texture of the fabric as it’s one of the few\n                  thick fabrics which I don’t have any issues with, and although\n                  it’s not an extensive vouch for different types of sensory\n                  overload triggers, the fact that it is inoffensive to my\n                  senses may allow for many others to wear it without issues.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Since all the different characters would be sharing the same\n                  cardigan and short base, I proceeded to sketch the base.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Once I had the sketch, I started thinking of how to portray\n                  each character through the loungewear set. I created a colour\n                  scheme for each character, including a main base colour for\n                  the fabric, the colour of their familiar (which would be\n                  featured on the cardigan), and another accent colour.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={colourPalette}\n                  alt=\"Colour scheme for the characters\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  Using the colour schemes, I drafted different versions of the\n                  set for all the characters.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={characterSets}\n                  alt=\"Character loungewear sets\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  I then went back to design the headbands, and decided to turn\n                  the ears of each familiar into the headband. However, this\n                  meant that Hu Tao, who had the ghost as the familiar, would\n                  not be able to have a headband.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={characterHeadbands}\n                  alt=\"Character headband designs\"\n                  width=\"50%\"\n                />\n                <p>\n                  I also designed some tote bags for stretch goals for some of\n                  the mascots.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard src={toteBags} alt=\"Tote bag designs\" width=\"90%\" />\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-block\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Initial Market Testing</h2>\n                <p>\n                  Due to the fact that a small portion of my current Instagram\n                  follower base overlaps with the Genshin Impact player base, I\n                  relied on other places to accurately determine whether there\n                  was a market for the loungewear sets. As such, I posted the\n                  designs on Reddit and Facebook instead, on which they received\n                  a lot of support and interest. However, the designs of the\n                  less popular characters seemed to be more popular than those\n                  that are more popular, perhaps due to the fact that there\n                  exists less merchandise for those characters, thereby creating\n                  a niche market. As such, I noted that those were probably the\n                  designs I should fund first.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Some people provided feedback on the designs as well, such as\n                  wanting purple bows for Scaramouche’s tote bag instead of red\n                  ones, and not wanting the name of the character embroidered on\n                  the bag. We took these suggestions and altered our designs\n                  accordingly.\n                </p>\n                <ImageCard\n                  src={newTotes}\n                  alt=\"Updated tote bag designs\"\n                  width=\"90%\"\n                />\n              </section>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"project-section\">\n          <div className=\"project-section-header\">\n            <h1>Design</h1>\n            <hr />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"text-block\">\n            <section>\n              <h2>Manufacturer Search</h2>\n              <p>\n                As comfort was the main selling point of the loungewear, I\n                focused mainly on finding a trustworthy manufacturer that could\n                provide me with the material I desired.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Since I was unsure of what the fabric’s name was, I could only\n                base the search off of detailed pictures, making it difficult to\n                verify if it was actually the material I required. Moreover, I\n                came across very few potential manufacturers on the English\n                Alibaba site and so, skeptical of the legitimacy of these\n                manufacturers as they had a lot of counterfeit Gelato Pique\n                designs, I wondered if the material is unique to a particular\n                manufacturer. I discovered that the original manufacturer of the\n                Gelato Pique sweaters was based in China, hence I went on the\n                Chinese Alibaba site, which offered me many more options. Being\n                able to write in Chinese myself, I was able to find the\n                manufacturer of the material after a thorough reverse-image\n                search. Although the 500 MOQ per design wasn’t the particularly\n                low, the representative said that I could split the 500 pieces\n                among different sizes, and as I wasn’t confident I could find a\n                manufacturer that used the same material, I proceeded onto\n                discussing sampling.\n              </p>\n              <ImageCard\n                src={fabric}\n                alt=\"Comfortable, soft fabric for the loungewear\"\n                width=\"70%\"\n              />\n            </section>\n            <section>\n              <h2>Prototype Sampling</h2>\n              <p>\n                I have had experience in the past with sampling through my tea\n                set project, but sampling loungewear had many differences,\n                albeit the similarities. For instance, while the teapot and\n                teacup required moulds to be created before the products could\n                be produced using machinery, clothing production involves a lot\n                of human labour and hence had more leeway for adjustments, but\n                also more room for error.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Nevertheless, I was still able to apply some of the lessons\n                learnt from the previous project. During the early talks about\n                sampling, I confirmed that they use the Pantone standard for\n                colouring and bought the actual Pantone book to ensure the right\n                colours will be used for the fabric. I also prepared all the\n                vector files for any jacquard or embroidery designs ahead of\n                time to ensure the process went smoothly, labelling all the\n
