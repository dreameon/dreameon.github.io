I decided to make the top piece a cardigan, which had more versatility than a normal loungewear top and allowed for layering. For the bottoms, I envisioned shorts, allowing the entire set to be worn year-long even in the warmer seasons and avoiding the feeling of being confined that normal long pants may give. It also lessened the problem of sizing, since pant sizing for long pants is fussier due to the varying lengths and waist sizes."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"To really make the set as comfortable as possible, I focused on ensuring that the fit of the loungewear sets would empower the person wearing it and make them feel good. As such, I went with a cute oversized fit for the cardigan, which is more forgiving for different sizes and body shapes. I also noted to make the shorts high waisted, as I know it\u2019s common among women to not want to feel exposed around the tummy area, and made sure that pockets, which are lacking in many women\u2019s clothing but highly coveted and useful, were present in both the cardigan and the shorts."),r.a.createElement(N,{src:Yt.a,alt:"Example of the Gelato Pique loungewear sets",width:"60%"}),r.a.createElement("p",null,"As an owner of one of Gelato Pique\u2019s products myself, I envisioned the loungewear set to have the same feel and touch.
